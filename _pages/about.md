I am a Law & Economics scholar at the National University of Singapore. My research interests lie at the intersection of law, economics, and policy.

## Research Interests

My work focuses on applying economic analysis to legal institutions and policy questions, with particular attention to how legal rules and institutions shape economic behavior and outcomes.
