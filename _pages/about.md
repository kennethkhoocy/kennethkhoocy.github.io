### [Expanding Shareholder Voice: The Impact of SEC Guidance on Environmental and Social Proposals](/publication/2024-expanding-shareholder-voice)
**With Roberto Tallarita** | *Journal of Law and Economics* (forthcoming)

After a dramatic increase over the past decade, shareholder support for environmental and social (E&S) proposals seems to have waned. In this Article, we examine whether this recent decline is linked to a 2021 shift in the SEC's policy, which expanded the ability of shareholders to influence E&S corporate decisions. We suggest that this regulatory shift has led to an increase in "prescriptive" E&S proposals, which typically call for more aggressive but costlier E&S policies by companies. Using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify prescriptive proposals, we find that these proposals generally receive less shareholder support and seem to be driving a substantial part of the decline in support for E&S proposals.

### [The Price of Delaware Corporate Law Reform](/publication/2025-price-of-delaware)
**With Roberto Tallarita** | *Under Review*

In 2025, Delaware legislators proposed and approved a major overhaul of the state's corporate law code (SB 21). The new statute contains more permissive rules for transactions involving conflicted controlling shareholders and places new constraints on shareholder-plaintiffs with the intent to curb fiduciary litigation. We conduct a series of event studies to measure the stock market's response to SB 21. Our findings are consistent with the critics' view that corporate law reform has reduced the shareholder value of Delaware companies. In particular, the market reaction suggests that Delaware's choice to relax the rules on controller conflicts harmed investors in controlled companies and dual-class companies, where minority shareholders are more vulnerable.

### [Visual Saliency and Investment Decisions](/publication/2025-visual-saliency)
**With Luca Enriques, Alfredo Desiato, Yoon-Ho Alex Lee, and Alessandro Romano** | *Under Review*

Despite regulatory efforts to improve fee transparency, investors persistently underweight fees and overweight past performance. This study employs webcam-based eye-tracking technology in a large-scale online experiment to investigate how manipulating the visual saliency of fees shapes investment decisions. The findings show that increasing fee saliency reduces time-to-first-fixation on past performance graphs by 47-75% and significantly increases dwell time on fees by 3-5.8%. These shifts in visual attention are associated with an 11.2% greater allocation to lower-fee funds in treatment groups compared to the control, with effects magnified for fund pairs exhibiting larger fee differentials.
