This course introduces core finance concepts tailored specifically for law students. Adopting a classical finance approach, it covers topics such as asset pricing, diversification, the Efficient Market Hypothesis, the Capital Asset Pricing Model, derivative pricing, financial intermediation, macroeconomic fundamentals, and capital structures. Additional coverage of mergers & acquisitions, corporate governance/law, and securities regulation where relevant highlights essential intersections with legal practice. By bridging the gap between law and finance, students will gain practical insights into how future clients such as investment bankers, traders, institutional investors, and other financial professionals operate.
