## Abstract

Despite regulatory efforts to improve fee transparency, investors persistently underweight fees and overweight past performance. This study employs webcam-based eye-tracking technology in a large-scale online experiment to investigate how manipulating the visual saliency of fees shapes investment decisions.

Participants allocated $100 between pairs of equity funds differing in fees and historical returns, with treatments enhancing fee prominence through larger font sizes or strategic screen placement (top/left).

The findings show that increasing fee saliency reduces time-to-first-fixation on past performance graphs by 47-75% and significantly increases dwell time on fees by 3-5.8%.

These shifts in visual attention are associated with an 11.2% greater allocation to lower-fee funds in treatment groups compared to the control, with effects magnified for fund pairs exhibiting larger fee differentials.
